# Accelerometer-Angle-Measure
2DP4 Final Course Project

This project uses the Esduino Xtreme (HCS12) microcontroller and the ADXL337 accelerometer to receive and output angle measurements of the device. The data is output to a series of 8 LEDs, converting the angle measure into BCD and also via serial communication, graphing it in in realtime using Python.
